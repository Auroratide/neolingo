As such, it is both my aspiration and my duty to make this website and all my products as accessible to everyone as possible, regardless of ability.

Some of the things I do include:</p> <ul><li>Reading established guidelines and standards, and evaluating my content against them.</li> <li>Testing every widget and article in a variety of conditions (for example, using a screen reader or foregoing a mouse).</li> <li>Providing at least two ways of accessing content (what I call the principle of engaging two senses).</li> <li>Only utilizing third-party components which themselves consider accessibility.</li></ul></section> <section><h2>Conformance</h2> <p class="svelte-vzca6z">The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" rel="noreferrer">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. My website is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA, meaning some parts of the website may not fully conform to the standard.</p> <p class="svelte-vzca6z">Partial compliance is due to the WCAG being a large and verbose standard. As a single person, I do what I can to meet as many of its principles as possible.</p></section> <section><h2>Feedback</h2> <p class="svelte-vzca6z">I am very open to discourse about improving the accessibility of anything I do!
